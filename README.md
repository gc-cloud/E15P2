# CSCI-E15: Project 1
### Portfolio /  Workflow Setup
This project presents a single landing page to access my portfolio at CSCI-E15. Place holder links to github and to the expected subdomains are provided initially.   This project also provides some information about me.  

### Repository Location
[GitHub gc-cloud E15](https://github.com/gc-cloud/E15P1)

### Live Site Location
Please visit [zudbu.com](http://p1.zudbu.com).  This domain is dedicated (currently) to my CSCIE15 work.

### Site organization
I decided to take on some of the extra challenges and am using a combination of PHP includes, Java Script and the Skeleton framework.  Although the PHP includes may seem silly for a one page site, I thought they might be useful in the future.
  - The main content is on index.php.  Head, Header and Footer content is obtained from calls to  head.php, header.php and footer.php
  - Collapsible menus (accordions) are based on the [jQuery User Interface](http://jqueryui.com)
  - The layout is mobile-first and responsive. To do this, I am using  [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com), a very clean and light boilerplate. Specific CSS for this site are defined on zudbu.css
  - We are obtaining the Raleway font from [Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
